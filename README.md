 --bg-gardient1:linear-gradient(135deg,hsl(0, 0%, 100%),hsl(0, 100%, 98%));
    --bg-gardient2:linear-gradient(135deg, hsl(0, 80%, 86%), hsl(0, 74%, 74%));
    --bg-gardient3:linear-gradient(135deg, hsl(0, 55%, 90%), hsl(0, 73%, 84%));
}    
```
```js
function isEmail(email){
    return /^[a-zA-Z0-9.!#$%&â€™*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+(?:\.[a-zA-Z0-9-]+)*$/.test(email);
}
```
